The patches in these repository are propositions, that will hopefuly
be merged in the main repository maintened by jaked.

Currently, it contains small bug fixes and code simplifications.

A long time target is to add a second code generator that use
first-class modules instead of recursive module. It will eventually
allow deriving non-regular datatypes.

Typing `make' in this directory should build both the preprocessor
(syntax/deriving) and the libraries (lib/deriving.cma,
lib/deriving.cmxa).

You can run the tests by changing to the test directory and building
and running the `tests' executable

   $ cd tests
   $ make
   ...
   $ ./tests
   Tests succeeded!

There's very limited documentation at present, but you should be able
to get started by looking at the test files.

Any comments are very welcome.
